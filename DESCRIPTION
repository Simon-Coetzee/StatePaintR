Description: Genome annotations are critical for understanding the likely function of disease variants and modeling cellular processes at the genome level. Methods exist for unsupervised learning of chromatin states from chromatin-IP sequencing (ChIPseq) of histone modifications. However, there is a need for efficient rules-based annotation models to test different ideas of the function of the epigenome. Therefore, we introduce methods for defining chromatin states in terms of co-occuring epigenomic annotations. In our view, these representations comprise models of the epigenome, which may be documented in tabular form and used for validation, comparison, and sharing between researchers. StateHub facilitates the creation of these models as a decision matrix mapping the complex relationship between data sources and chromatin state. These models describe annotation even in the absence of a full complement of data, degrading gracefully by providing the most accurate annotations possible. This feature enables a single model to be executed across arbitrary collections of experiments and cell types. StatePaintR implements model-based annotations from StateHub to produce a fully documented and color-coded browser track (including links to the model specification on the StateHub webpage, genome version and source files) in UCSC bed format compatible with modern genome browsers. In addition to these features, StatePaintR will rank (when possible) features according to the average peak rank of any data that are required for the definition of that feature, enabling confidence estimates based on experimental evidence. We show examples of some basic models to illustrate the application of these tools, including 1) an annotation of ENCODE and Roadmap datasets, 2) functional enrichment of differentially methylated loci from ovarian cancer in Roadmap tissues and 3) a comparison between two closely related models that differ in their interpretation of histone marks. The StateHub-StatePaintR models and framework can be used to annotate the genome of any organism for which genomic datasets exist.
